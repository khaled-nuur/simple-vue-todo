# Vue.js ToDo app.
[app on CodePen](https://codepen.io/khaled_pens/full/MvNmeq)

![screen shot of the app as .gif](https://github.com/khaled-nuur/simple-vue-todo/blob/master/screen%20shot.gif "the app in my browser!")
an app I built after learning Vue for about 2 days (3-4h/day)*but without concentration!*.

just 'Hello, World' in Vue/any UI framework, hope you enjoy it.
## Tools :
- [Vue](vuejs.org) : Progrerssive UI framework
- [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) : no need to explain
- [Paper](https://bootswatch.com/paper) : Material Design theme for Bootstrap from the Bootswatch.
- [Web Maker](https://webmakerapp.com/) : a Chrome extension, I use it to test small things, while reading. a CodePen-like exprience.
- [Brackets Editor](http://brackets.io/) : powerful editor. give it a look!
## And then?
1. read the code
2. request a missing feature or open issue (*if found..*)
3. fallow me on GitHub & Twitter.
4. star the Rebo.
5. and say helloo/good bye!
## we are not at the end
